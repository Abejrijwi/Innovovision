                <h2>Transform Your Approach to Compliance From Concept to Market</h2>
                


                <h3 class="text-justify">Today’s drug and medical device manufacturers have several common challenges. First, nearly all are being impacted by the shifting global regulatory compliance environment as they simultaneously strive to stay ahead of the competition while safely and effectively meeting the needs of patients. Additionally, compliance has typically been seen as a department, not a shared responsibility, and collectively perceived as a cost center, not a value center.</h3>
                <h3 class="text-justify">The following blog from IQVIA’s U.S. Center of Compliance Excellence addresses why, despite these challenges, leading Life Science organizations are now recognizing there is opportunity for innovation in quality, regulatory, safety, and commercial compliance activities that will drive up both the perceived and the actual value of a Compliance-based approach from concept to market.</h3>
